title: "On an Equivalency of Rare Differentiation Bases of Rectangles"
date: "2018-03-09"
abstract: "The paper considers differentiation properties of density bases formed of bounded open sets.We prove that two quasi-equivalent subbases of some density basis differentiate the same class of non-negative functions. Applications for bases formed of rectangles are discussed."
