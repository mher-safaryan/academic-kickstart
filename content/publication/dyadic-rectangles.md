title: "On an equivalence for differentiation bases of dyadic rectangles"
date: "2016-12-02"
abstract: "The paper considers differentiation properties of rare bases of dyadic rectangles corresponding to increasing sequences {\nu_k} of integers. We prove that the condition sup_k (\nu_{k+1}−\nu_k)<∞ is necessary and sufficient for such a basis to be equivalent to the full basis of dyadic rectangles."
