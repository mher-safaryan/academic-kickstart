title: "On Generalizations of Fatou's Theorem in $L^p$ for Convolution Integrals with General Kernels"
date: "2019-05-29"
abstract: "We prove Fatou type theorem on almost everywhere convergence of convolution integrals in spaces Lp(1<p<∞) for general kernels, forming an approximate identity. For a wide class of kernels we show that obtained convergence regions are optimal in some sense. It is also established a weak boundedness of the corresponding maximal operator in Lp(1≤p<∞)."
