title: "On a theorem of Littlewood"

# draft: true
abstract: "In 1927 Littlewood constructed an example of bounded holomorphic function on the unit disk, which diverges almost everywhere along rotated copies of any given curve in the unit disk ending tangentially to the boundary. This theorem was the complement of a positive theorem of Fatou 1906, establishing almost everywhere nontangential convergence of bounded holomorphic functions. There are several generalizations of the Littlewood's theorem which proofs are based on the specific properties of Poisson kernel. We generalize Littlewood's theorem for operators having general kernels."
